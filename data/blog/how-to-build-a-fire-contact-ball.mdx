# build your own fire contact ball

Building your own fire contact ball is not that difficult.
All you need is a needle, a kevlar string, a kevlar rope and do some stitching.

Kevlar is unfortunately not very easy to source anymore.
My main source before was JustJuggling, but unfortunately this shop has closed.
The shop owner Alan has told me that Kevlar is increasingly hard to source from.
However there is a very good German online shop with very good prices called [Sam's feuershow](shop.feuershow.de)

You can get the Kevlar thread here

Kevlar Rope 10mm: https://shop.feuershow.de/Standard-Dochtseil-Rope-in-Rope-Lfm-O-10-mm-125-mm
You can find the 80mm aluminium ball on ebay or amazon.
Approximate cost for all the tools: 40-45â‚¬
