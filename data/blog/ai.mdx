summary: I have created a few versions of the flow wizard using ai generated artwork. Here I showcase you how it was done and tell you about the evolution of the three tools 'Dall-E', 'stable diffusion' and 'Midjourney'. I hereby present you The Flow Wizard AI artwork üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In the world of ai generated images, three AI models stand out for their unique
capabilities and potential to create images from a simple text prompt:
Midjourney, Dall-E, and Stable Diffusion.
By inputing a simple sentence it generates you what was described in it.

# Dall-E

In June 2022 Dall-E has generated this image for me with
this prompt: 'An oil painting of a fire contact juggling wizard'.

Pretty impressive, right? The image generation with Dall-E is resourceful and
creative.

# Midjourney

Midjourney is very user friendly. All you have to do is enter the discord chat,
enter a chatroom and enter `/imagine An oil painting of a fire contact juggling wizard`
and it gives you the created output. The latest version of stable diffusion up to this
post is version 4 which was released in mid November 2022 and it is incredible! Six months after the first render with Dall-E, midjourney clearly puts Dall-E in it's shadow with it's incredibly detailed and accurate image generations.
These two images were generated using the following prompt:

`/imagine fire mage holds fire ball in his hand and juggles it around his body in an action pose in a dark forest, he has bright glowing blue eyes and long dark blonde hair high contrast, HDR, 8k, super detailed, --v 4`

These were the first pictures that I generated with midjourney which really impressed me.
But the guy doesn't look anything like the flow wizard. The flow wizard wears a
hood and has a mysterious sharp look in his face.
I wanted to get more of a portrait picture of a wizard
which feels like the flow wizard to me which is why I tried a few variations of
**portrait** prompts and came up with some pictures that I really started
to like. Here I present you a couple of those results:

`/imagine A mage with a smooth, sharp chin and high cheekbones. A pointed hood covers his face down to his eyes, of which only a glint is visible. --v 4`

I really Love these images! Dark and mysterious. Here are a few more Midjourney generated images that impressed me very much:
