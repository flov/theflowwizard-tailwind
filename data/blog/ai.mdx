# Dall-E

Dall-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are three AI deep learning models that can
be used to generate images based on a natural language descriptions, called
"prompts". By inputing a simple sentence it generates you what was described in it.

In June 2022 Dall-E has generated this image for me with
this prompt: 'An oil painting of a fire contact juggling wizard'.

Pretty impressive, right?
The image generation with Dall-E is resourceful and
incredibly creative.

# Midjourney

Midjourney is very user friendly. All you have to do is enter the discord chat,
enter a chatroom and enter `/imagine An oil painting of a fire contact juggling wizard`
and it gives you the created output. The latest version of stable diffusion up to this
post is version 4 which was released in mid November 2022 and it is incredible! Six months after the first render with Dall-E, midjourney clearly puts Dall-E in it's shadow with it's incredibly detailed and accurate image generations.
These two images were generated using the following prompt:

`/imagine fire mage holds fire ball in his hand and juggles it around his body in an action pose in a dark forest, he has bright glowing blue eyes and long dark blonde hair high contrast, HDR, 8k, super detailed, --v 4`

What a time to be alive, where we can generate such Photo
realisitic images of our imagination.
